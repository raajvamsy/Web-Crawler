# Web-Crawler
This is a Basic Web crawler created using selenium and python.

How to use this:
Create an object for Crawler class with depth and address as parameters and call crawler function which returns a list of urls on completion.

  {object-name}= Crawler(depth={value},address={value}) 
	
  {List of urls} = {object-name}.crawler() 

We can also crawl multiple sites by creating an array of objects and use Multiproccessing or Threads. :)
